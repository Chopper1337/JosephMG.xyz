<h2>Maths Week 1</h2>
<p>Please note that the use of 'E' should be recognised as the sets symbol for &quot;Element of&quot; and '!E' should be recognised as &quot;Not an Element of&quot; for this document.</p>

<h3>Cartesian Product</h3>
<p>The Cartesian Product of two sets is the set of all ordered pairs between the two sets.</p>
<p>Example:
X = {a,b,c} and Y = {w,z}</p>
<p>X*Y = The Cartesian Product, which is the following</p>
<p>X*Y={(a,w),(a,z),(b,w),(b,z),(c,w),(c,z)}</p>
<h3>Relation</h3>
<p>A Relation between sets X and Y is any subset of the Cartesian Product X*Y</p>
<p>Example:
Referring to the X and Y sets from the previous example, we can define realtions R, S and T as</p>
<p>R={(a,w),(b,w),(c,z)}</p>
<p>S={(a,w),(b,w)}</p>
<p>T={(a,w),(c,w),(c,z)}</p>
<h3>Domain</h3>
<p>A Domain of a Relation is the set of the first components of the Realtion</p>
<p>Example:
If R is a Relation from set X to set Y</p>
<p>Then Domain R = {x|(x,y),E R}</p>
<p>Example:
Looking at R, S and T in the previous example</p>
<p>Domain R = {a,b,c}</p>
<p>Domain S = {a,b}</p>
<p>Domain T = {a,c,z}</p>
<h3>Range of a Relation</h3>
<p>The Range of a Relation is the set of the second components of the pairings in the Relation.
If a value repeats, you don't include it twice.</p>
<p>Range R = {y|(x,y),E R}</p>
<p>Range R = {w,z}</p>
<p>Range S = {w}</p>
<p>Range T = {w,z}</p>
<h3>Domain Restriction (Left Restriction)</h3>
<p>In general, given a Relation R from sets X to Y</p>
<p>If T is a subset of the set X: T (Left Restrcition) R = {(x,y)|x E T and (x,y) E R}</p>
<p>i.e All pairings in R whose first component lies in T.</p>
<h3>Domain Anti-Restriction</h3>
<p>If T is a subset of X: T (Anti-Restriction) X = {(x,y) | !E T and (x,y) E R}</p>
<h3>Range Restriction</h3>
<p>If w is a subset of Y, then R restricted to w = {(x,y) | y E W and (x,y) E R}</p>
<p>i.e All pairings in R whose second component lies in W</p>
<h3>Range Anti-Restriction</h3>
<p>If w is a subset of Y, then R anti-restricted to w = {(x,y) | y !E w and (x,y) E R}</p>
<h3>Forward Composition</h3>
<p>We can combine two relations by using forward composition. The symbol is ';'</p>
<p>If R and S are relations, we do R first and then S</p>
<p>Note: In forward composition, the final ordered pairing consists of the starting value and the end value. There is a link that connects those two values.</p>
<p>If R is a relation that maps to set X to set Y and S is a relation that maps set Y to set Z</p>
<p>Then R;S maps set X to set Z</p>
<p>R;S = {(x,y) | there exists y E Y such that (x,y) E R and (x,z) E S}</p>
